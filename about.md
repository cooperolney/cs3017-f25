My name is Cooper Olney and I'm from Waterbury Vermont. I'm currently a junior at St. Lawrence University majoring in Data Science and possibly minoring in Math.
I have a dog named Bo and a cat named Luna.

## My Hobbies

Some of my hobbies include skiing, it has always been one of my favorite ways to enjoy the outdoors during winter. 
Growing up I mostly skied at Stowe Mountain, and more recently I've been skiing at Whiteface.
I also play soccer, and am a member of the club soccer team at SLU. In addition I enjoy golfing whenever I can, espically during the summer.
